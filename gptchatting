next task:
I want to add support for notifications that will be sent using firebase. Notifications will be sent when loan.expected payment is now.
This means that the user will be notified when the expected payment date is now.
Array of expected payments is stored in the loan.expected_payments. Each expected payment has a timespamp field, that is the date when the payment is expected.
If the timestamp is now, then the user should be notified.
Add a new function to the loan model, that will be called notify.
notify function will be called by setInterval that is started when this nodejs app is started.
Todo plan:

1. Add a new field to the loan.expected_payments, that will be called notified. This field will be boolean and will be false by default.
2. Add a new function to the loan model, that will be called notify. This function will check if the loan.expected_payments array contains any expected payments that have a timestamp that is older than now and have the notified field set to false. If there are any expected payments that meet these conditions, then the user will be notified.
3. Notify function will user firebase to send a notifications to the user.
4. This is the code to be used:
